The Google Play app is a center where to customize Android devices, being a default app on most phones or tablets. With this app, you can access, download, install, update and/or use varied content types, for e.g., applications, games, music, movies or TV shows, e-Books, etc.

If the Android was rooted or if the Google Play Store app is not installed (for many Meizu phones or tablets, for e.g.), you can download, install or update it manually. Learn from this article what is the Google Play Store, where you can download it from and how to install it.


### What is Google Play?

Google Play is an application developed by Google that allows users to download and install different types of applications, including games, and to access multimedia content from Android devices (the most popular operating system for portable devices - smartphones, tablets, etc.).

The app or digital content developers can share their products on Google Play, both for free and for a fee, and users of Android devices will be able to access the desired multimedia content or to install apps, games, and so on. In February 2017 there was available a collection of 2.7 million Android Apps.

Google Play combines multiple applications, like Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Music, and Google Play Newsstand - all these being independent applications since before 2012 when the current version of Google Play was launched.

The application can have several different names, depending on the Android version, but also on the default system language, for e.g., Google Play Store, Google Store, Play Store, and so forth. And it is a part of the apps suit offered by Google through various Google Play services, which are running on Android by default.
Downloading, installing, updating or accessing Google Play content, can only be done if you have an existing Google Account.


### How to download and install Google Play (Magazin Play)

Here is the way how to manually install or update the Google Play store.

**1) Enable the installation option of apps from unknown sources**

As a security measure, Android's standard default settings do not allow the installation of third-party apps or games, being downloaded from unknown or unauthorized sources by Google. This setting can be changed, allowing to install apps that do not exist on Google Play, for instance.

To enable the option, follow the instructions:
Go to Settings â†’ Security.
Check the Unknown Sources box.
Confirm this operation

**2) Download Google Play Store (Magazin Play)**

At apkmirror.com, there is a big collection of Android apps which can be installed manually instead of using Google Play, and this includes the Google Play app itself, however, named Google Play Store.

The Google Play Store download page is here. All you have to do is download the latest version of it.

If there is not any compatible version for your device, then you can install the Google Play services (here), which also include Google Play Store.

**3) Install Google Play Store**

To install the application, go to the download folder, Downloads, on your Android device.
Open the file containing the Google Play Store app - it has the .apk extension.
The installation window will appear. Press the Install button.

Wait for the process to end, then close the window by pressing the Done button, or immediately open Google Play by pressing the Open button.

Then, you can access the application from the main app screen.

Once you have accessed the Google Play app, Google Play services will subsequently be installed as well, if there is an Internet connection and if settings allow it, as well. In other words, installing Google Play can also be a solution to both install Google Play Services and vice versa.
