Google Play is, in many ways, the most important Android app. The user can utilize it to install a vast collection of Android apps. The user can also access and/or download various digital content such as music, movies, books, electronic magazines, etc., both for a fee and free of charge, depending on the license type under which the content is offered.

Learn from this article everything you need to know about Google Play: where to find the application, where to download it from, and how to install the application if it does not exist on your phone or tablet, how to use it and how to solve issues regarding accessing or downloading content.

Note: The application has several names, depending on the device manufacturer, the system language, and the Android version, but all of them refer to the same application. If the system language is Romanian, the usual names are Magazin Play, Magazin Google Play, and Google Play Magazin while in English are used names such as Google Play, Play Store, and Google Play Store.

### Where to find the Google Play app


The application is preinstalled on most Android phones and tablets, but also on Chromebooks, apart from some devices where the manufacturer offers a similar application to Google Play (for the most part, the available content will be different from what Google offers).

For instance, the phones and tablets developed by Asian producers (Meizu, Xiaomi, etc.), provide a separate application from the Google Play for users in the region. In this case, Google Play will not be installed on the device by default and, in some cases, it will not be even possible to install the application manually.

Usually, a shortcut to Google Play Store is located on the main screen.

In case Google Play does not appear on the main screen, the user has to search it on the screen where all the apps are installed. For a faster identification, search the application by using the Google Play's logo - illustrated in the image from the introduction.

To make sure the Google Play app does not exist on your phone/tablet, you can search for the application by its name. From the Apps screen, go to the Search icon and enter Google Play, or the Play Store. If this exists, it will appear in the search results.

Haven't you found the Google Play? Here's what you can do about it:


### What can you do when you do not find the Google Play Store?

If you do not find the application, the first thing you need to do is to restart the device, then check if this is installed and turned on.

Go to **Settings → go to General → Apps → scroll sideways to All** → search for the Google Play / Google Play Store app.


If there is not any application with this name, then you will have to download and install Google Play Store manually - see below.

However, if the application appears on the list, then you have to make sure that this is enabled. Access the application, and if disabled, activate it by pressing the Enable button.

If the Disable button appears, it means the Play Store is already enabled, and in this case, you can choose to disable and then reactivate the application. Next, restart the device and see if the store appeared in the menu with Android apps.


### Download the Play Store app and install/update it manually

There are rare cases when the Play Store app is not installed by default on your phone/ tablet but fortunately, there is an option to install the app manually. The process consists in setting the device to support installing apps from external sources (that does not belong to the manufacturer), downloading the Play Store app in an installable format (apk), and initiating the setting of the app on the device.

All these steps are presented in the article: Download and install Play Store | Tutorial

If the application appears to be installed but it cannot be found, manually installing the application will result in updating the Play Store to a newer version or a particular version.


### How to use Google Play

To use the application, you need a Google Account. Once accessed, this allows you to install apps and games, and also to access and download digital content, such as music, movies, books, electronic magazines, and so on.

The existing content is available either for free or for a fee or a mix of the two and offers the certainty that distribution is legal. Regarding the apps and games for Android, there is also a high level of confidence about content security, which is tested against viruses and malicious actions. This aspect is not valid when downloading them from the Internet, from sources that are not as secure as Google.

Moreover, this app allows the management of applications, games, and digital content, on all the devices connected to a specific Google account. This aspect is useful, especially for the purchased apps and content because this becomes available on any device (phone, tablet, PC) of the user.

The guiding principle is simple: open the Play Store, browse for the desired application, initiate the download operation, confirm the access rights to Android features, and wait for the install process to finish. In the case of digital content, the access to content is possible either by downloading the content directly to the device or by getting the right to access online digital resources.

### Who creates existing apps, games and digital content on Google Play, and why?


The well-known Google company, due to the Play Store, mediates the apps and content distribution, between developers/creators, and consumers. Thus, developers/creators display their applications/content to a large number of users in a competitive environment based on performance and utility. And users have quick access to applications and content that have already been tested by other users and provided under legal and safe conditions for the device.

Generally, the apps and content are provided for making a profit, but sometimes these are offered for free. In addition to direct marketing of applications and content, another way to generate a profit is to offer some features or auxiliary content for a fee, which are distinct from the free and standard ones. Another way is to display advertisements within applications.
