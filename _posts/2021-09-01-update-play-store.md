Generally, the Google Play Store app is set to update itself automatically when new versions of the application are released. However, depending on the settings and the Internet connection type (via 3G/4G or Wi-Fi), sometimes updating can be done only manually.

There are two ways to update Google Play: by using the Google Play Store app or by downloading the APK Magazin Play (an installable app) and reinstalling it separately.


### Google Play Update - the recommended way

The easiest way to upgrade is directly from the application, from the Settings menu â€“ assuming that Google Play can be accessed. Of course, you also need an Internet connection, preferably via Wi-Fi.

Go to Google Play and tap the Options button - the three vertical lines.

In the About section, you can see which is the current version of the application. To initiate the update, you have to tap the option Play Store Version.

Search for the latest Google Play version, and if there is one, an info message will appear, and you will have to press the Install button. If the Google Play Store on your phone/tablet has already been updated to the latest version, then a message like the one below will appear:

If Google Play cannot be accessed, for e.g., because the Android system was updated to the latest version, and the current version of Google Play has some technical issues, then you have to restart the phone or tablet and redo the instructions. If the problem persists, then the application should be updated as follows.


### Update Google Play by reinstalling the application manually - an alternative way

In cases Google Play cannot be accessed, showing errors or displaying the main menu, you can install a newer Google Play version, by downloading the application from an external source and reinstalling it on the Android system. It is even possible to install a specific version of Google Play, and not only the latest one.

Check all the steps you have to follow to update the Google Play app: download and install Google Play Store.

Updating Google Play Store is optional. Android and installed apps can smoothly run without updates. However, there are situations when you cannot install apps or games without installing the latest version, or you cannot download digital content. In these cases, the update operation must be done manually, according to the two ways presented above.
